# Contribution guide

**All contributors are to be acknowledged.**

## Workflow

We follow the standard "Fork and pull" model.  Read more about it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model) and [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## Bugs, tasks, etc

Use this repo's GitHub Issues liberally to document bugs, feature requests, tasks (even if it's a cry for community help :), etc

## Testing

The testing framework is rudimentary at best as of right now. Please ensure to cover contributions through the use of unit tests in src/tests/test.py

## Code of Conduct

Above all else, show respect to all you encounter.  You do that and we will be fine.
